\section{Introduction}
The Helmholtz equation defined as $\Delta u(x) + \frac{\omega^2}{c^2(x)}u(x)=f(x)$ 
is a time-independent factorization of the wave equation, where $w$ is angular 
frequency, $c(x)$ is the velocity field, and $f(x)$ is the external force. 
Many different approaches exist for numerically solving the Helmholtz equation 
in a discretized system. 

Boundary conditions must be handled properly when numerically solving a 
wave equation on a finite grid. The Sommerfeld condition for waves that propagate to an 
infinite distance is not satisfied when computing on a finite domain. This leads to 
non-physical reflections at the boundaries \cite{erlangga2008advances}. The typical 
correction is to impose absorbing boundary conditions. The perfectly matched layer (PML) 
\cite{berenger1994perfectly} is one common method for absorbing waves at the boundaries. 
The PML method adds a damping region around the original domain (or within it) and 
accordingly modifies the equation we are solving. The PML reduces non-physical
reflections and provides a more favorable system to solve for, but it also adds
computational cost.

Certain iterative methods can be applied for solving the Helmholtz equation. They require 
preconditioning due to the Helmholtz system's indefiniteness. The methods in 
\cite{engquist2011pml} and \cite{engquist2011matrix} apply a sweeping preconditioner and
iteratively solve the system using GMRES \cite{saad1986gmres}. Both methods use the PML to arrive
at initial system. Their key observation is that the system can be factorized into a form
where block matrices correspond to the Helmholtz Green's function and are highly compressible.
In \cite{engquist2011matrix}, these matrices are approximated using the hierarchical matrices. 
In \cite{engquist2011pml}, these matrices are represented by inverting a Helmholtz system with 
a moving PML. In 2D, both methods take $O(N)$ time. %, thereby improving on direct methods described in the following paragraph.

The frontal solver \cite{irons1970frontal} is a direct method for solving sparse 
systems in a manner similar to Gaussian elimination. The frontal solver extracts 
small blocks (fronts) within the sparse $A$ matrix for eliminating variables/equations. 
The multifrontal solver \cite{duff1983multifrontal} extends this method to process 
multiple independent fronts in parallel. For a 2D Helmholtz problem with $N=n^2$ unknowns, 
the multifrontal method takes $O(N^{3/2})$ time and $O(N \log N)$ space. The method 
becomes inefficient for 3D problems with $N=n^3$ unknowns, where it takes $O(N^2)$ 
time and $O(N^{4/3})$ space \cite{engquist2011matrix}. Direct methods also suffer 
from fill-in \cite{erlangga2008advances} that occurs during the Gaussian elimination process.

In this project, I will implement the sweeping preconditioner with the moving PML as 
described in \cite{engquist2011pml}. The general method is as follows.
Work in the 2D domain $(x_1, x_2) \in (0,1)^2$ discretized on an $n$ x $n$ grid where the number 
of grid points $N=n^2$. 
Assume Dirichlet zero boundary conditions at $x_2=1$. Approximations to the Sommerfeld 
boundary conditions are imposed on the other three sides (absorbing layers) using a PML 
(equations provided in the paper).
A 5-point stencil is used to generate the $A$ matrix, which can be block-$LDL^T$-factorized. 
This factorization eliminates unknowns layer by layer, starting from $x_2=0$ (hence ``sweeping 
factorization''). 
Inverting the factorization of $A$ can be used to solve for $u$ as described in Algorithms 
2.1 and 2.2 in the paper. However, this takes $O(N^{3/2})$, which is no better than a 
multifrontal (direct) method. On closer observation, $A^{-1}$ truncated to the first $m$ layers 
approximates the discrete half-space Green's function of the Helmholtz equation with 
zero boundary conditions. Similarly, the $m$th block matrix (denoted as $T_m$) in the 
factorization's diagonal corresponds to the same Green's function restricted to $x_2=mh$
with zero boundary at $x_2=(m+1)h$. $T_m$ maps an external force loaded on the $m$th layer 
to the solution in the $m$th layer. Therefore, for approximating $T_m$, the PML can be 
moved up from $x_2=0$ to $x_2=mh$. The approximation to $T_m$ can be solved for efficiently
in a small subgrid where the moved PML lies (by the $m$th layer) and applied
efficiently. Algorithms 2.3 and 2.4 in the paper describe this method and how to
ultimately solve for $u$ with time complexity $O(N)$. In the end, the algorithm
solves $\Delta u(x) + \frac{(\omega+i\alpha)^2}{c^2(x)}u(x)=f(x)$, where $\alpha$
is $O(1)$ and small.
